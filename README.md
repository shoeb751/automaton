# Automaton

This is a list of all my automations that I am contributing to the community

A last ditch effort to contribute things back to the community from my side

## How to use

Each folder will have automations related to a specific applications
and a README.md file that will describe how to use it and security considerations
if any realted to the autoamtion. (Most of them are going to have a lot of them)

## Contributing

If you make any automation better, just send a PR and I will add it to my repo if
I can use it on a daya to day basis

## Disclaimer

I take no responsibility if you shoot yourself in the foot while trying to use any of these

They are in many cases advanced automations and you need to know what you are doing else
do not use this.

## Licence

Use it for personal use only, do not sell it to people, do not add in products to be sold.
